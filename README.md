# basic-neural-net
Python repository for a basic neural network with no external helpers

This was purely built over a weekend as I was intruiged how CNN work and wanted to gain a deeper understanding. 

I was also reading [NNFS](https://nnfs.io) at the time so was using that for inspiration as I was attempting to understand the complexities of gradient descent and cross-entropy.
